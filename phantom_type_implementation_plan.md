# EventCore Phantom Type Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document provides detailed implementation plans for each identified phantom type opportunity, prioritized by value, risk, performance impact, and implementation complexity.

## Priority 1: Projection Runner Protocol Phases (IMMEDIATE)

### Overview
- **Value**: MODERATE
- **Risk**: LOW
- **Performance Impact**: POSITIVE (eliminates runtime state checks)
- **Complexity**: LOW
- **Timeline**: 2-3 days

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Define Protocol Phase Types (Day 1 Morning)
```rust
// In src/projection/protocol.rs
pub mod phases {
    use std::marker::PhantomData;
    
    pub struct Setup;
    pub struct Processing;
    pub struct Checkpointing;
    pub struct Shutdown;
    
    pub trait Phase: Send + Sync + 'static {}
    impl Phase for Setup {}
    impl Phase for Processing {}
    impl Phase for Checkpointing {}
    impl Phase for Shutdown {}
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Typed Projection Protocol (Day 1 Afternoon)
```rust
pub struct ProjectionProtocol<Ph: Phase, P: Projection> {
    projection: P,
    stats: ProjectionStats,
    event_store: Arc<dyn EventStore>,
    checkpoint_store: Arc<dyn CheckpointStore>,
    _phase: PhantomData<Ph>,
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement Phase Transitions (Day 2 Morning)
- Setup → Processing: After configuration validation
- Processing → Checkpointing: When checkpoint threshold reached
- Checkpointing → Processing: After successful checkpoint save
- Any → Shutdown: On graceful shutdown request

#### Step 4: Migrate Existing Code (Day 2 Afternoon)
- Create adapter from existing ProjectionRunner to new protocol
- Maintain backward compatibility with type aliases
- Update internal implementation to use new types

#### Step 5: Testing & Documentation (Day 3)
- Property tests for state transition invariants
- Integration tests with real projections
- Migration guide for users
- Update examples

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing projection tests pass with new implementation
- [ ] Compile-time prevention of invalid state transitions
- [ ] No performance regression in benchmarks
- [ ] Clear migration path documented

### Risk Mitigation
- Feature flag for gradual rollout
- Extensive testing before making default
- Maintain old API during transition period

## Priority 2: Enhanced Command Execution State Machine

### Overview
- **Value**: HIGH
- **Risk**: MODERATE
- **Performance Impact**: POSITIVE (better compiler optimizations)
- **Complexity**: MODERATE
- **Timeline**: 1 week

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Extend Existing Typestate Pattern (Day 1-2)
```rust
// In src/executor/typestate_v2.rs
pub mod states {
    pub struct Initialized;
    pub struct StreamsDeclared;
    pub struct StreamsValidated;
    pub struct EventsRead;
    pub struct StateReconstructed;
    pub struct BusinessLogicExecuted;
    pub struct EventsWritten;
    pub struct Completed;
}

pub struct CommandExecution<State, C: Command> {
    command: Arc<C>,
    context: ExecutionContext,
    input: Option<C::Input>,
    streams: Option<Vec<StreamId>>,
    events: Option<Vec<StoredEvent>>,
    state: Option<C::State>,
    result: Option<Vec<EventWrite>>,
    _phantom: PhantomData<State>,
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement Transition Methods (Day 3-4)
- Each transition validates preconditions at compile time
- Use builder pattern for required data at each phase
- Return Result types for fallible operations

#### Step 3: Integrate with Existing Executor (Day 5)
- Refactor CommandExecutor to use new typestate flow
- Maintain existing public API
- Internal implementation uses type-safe transitions

#### Step 4: Performance Optimization (Day 6)
- Benchmark against current implementation
- Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency
- Ensure zero-cost abstractions

#### Step 5: Testing & Documentation (Day 7)
- Comprehensive test suite for all transitions
- Property tests for execution invariants
- Update architecture documentation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Type system prevents execution order violations
- [ ] Performance improvement of 5-10% in benchmarks
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid transitions

### Risk Mitigation
- Incremental refactoring of executor internals
- Extensive benchmarking at each step
- Fallback to original implementation if issues

## Priority 3: Subscription Lifecycle Management

### Overview
- **Value**: HIGH
- **Risk**: MODERATE
- **Performance Impact**: NEUTRAL
- **Complexity**: MODERATE
- **Timeline**: 1 week

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Define Subscription States (Day 1)
```rust
// In src/subscription/lifecycle.rs
pub mod states {
    pub struct Uninitialized;
    pub struct Configured;
    pub struct Starting;
    pub struct Running;
    pub struct Pausing;
    pub struct Paused;
    pub struct Resuming;
    pub struct Stopping;
    pub struct Stopped;
    pub struct Failed { error: SubscriptionError };
}
```

#### Step 2: Create Typed Subscription (Day 2-3)
- Generic over state and event type
- Encapsulate subscription internals
- Type-safe state transitions

#### Step 3: Implement State Machine (Day 4-5)
- Valid transitions only (e.g., can't pause stopped subscription)
- Async transitions with proper error handling
- Resource cleanup in state destructors

#### Step 4: Migration Strategy (Day 6)
- Adapter pattern for existing subscription API
- Feature flag for opt-in usage
- Gradual migration path

#### Step 5: Testing & Integration (Day 7)
- State machine property tests
- Integration with existing subscription manager
- Performance benchmarks

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Compile-time prevention of invalid lifecycle operations
- [ ] Clear error handling for failed transitions
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Improved developer experience

- **Risk**: LOW
- **Performance Impact**: NEUTRAL
- **Complexity**: LOW

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Define Resource Protocol (Day 1)
```rust
// In src/infrastructure/resource.rs
pub trait ManagedResource: Send + Sync {
    type Handle;
    fn acquire() -> Result<Self::Handle, ResourceError>;
    fn release(handle: Self::Handle) -> Result<(), ResourceError>;
}

pub struct Resource<R: ManagedResource, State> {
    handle: Option<R::Handle>,
    _state: PhantomData<State>,
}
```

#### Step 2: Implement for Database Connections (Day 2)

- Unit tests for resource lifecycle
- Integration with connection pooling
- Usage examples

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Zero use-after-release bugs possible
- [ ] Clean API for resource management
- [ ] Works with existing infrastructure

### Risk Mitigation
- Start with single resource type
- Gradual expansion to other resources
- Maintain compatibility with existing code

- Regular reviews of phantom type usage
- Monitor Rust language evolution for new patterns
- Community feedback incorporation
- Performance regression testing

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a pragmatic approach to enhancing EventCore's type safety through phantom types. By starting with low-risk, high-value improvements and gradually moving to more complex patterns, we can deliver immediate benefits while maintaining system stability.

The focus remains on practical improvements that enhance developer experience and system reliability without over-engineering. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a solid foundation for future type system enhancements.
