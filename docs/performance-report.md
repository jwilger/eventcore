# EventCore Performance Validation Report

## Executive Summary

Performance validation tests have been successfully executed against PostgreSQL with **real benchmark data**. **Major progress achieved**: Single-stream command business logic now works with 100% success rate. However, performance targets are not yet met due to throughput limitations and a critical bug in multi-stream event writing pipeline.

## Test Environment

- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 (Docker container)
- **Schema**: Standard non-partitioned schema (migrations 001-003)
- **Test Framework**: Fixed PostgreSQL-only benchmarks
- **Execution**: Real database with proper schema alignment

## Performance Results

### Single-Stream Commands (Financial Transactions)

**Test Configuration**:
- Operations: 1,000 financial transactions
- Pattern: Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers across 20 accounts
- Target: 5,000-10,000 ops/sec

**Results** (Latest - 2025-07-01):
- **Throughput**: 62-90 ops/sec ‚ùå (55-80x below minimum target)
- **Success Rate**: 100% (1,000/1,000 successful) ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- **P95 Latency**: 14-20ms ‚ùå (exceeds 10ms target)
- **Total Duration**: 11-16 seconds

**Analysis**: ‚úÖ **Major improvement** - Business logic validation now works perfectly with 100% success rate. However, PostgreSQL-based operations are inherently slower than targets, likely due to database round-trips and transaction overhead.

### Multi-Stream Commands (E-commerce Orders)

**Test Configuration**:
- Operations: 5-500 e-commerce orders  
- Pattern: Orders with 2-5 products each across multiple streams
- Target: 2,000-5,000 ops/sec

**Results** (Latest - 2025-07-01):
- **Throughput**: 0.00 ops/sec ‚ùå (total failure)
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/500 successful) ‚ùå
- **P95 Latency**: 0.00ms (no successful operations)
- **Total Duration**: 1.9 seconds

**Analysis**: ‚ùó **Critical EventCore Bug Identified** - Business logic validation now passes correctly (inventory validation works, streams are properly set up), but multi-stream commands fail at the event writing stage with error: `EventStore(Internal("No events to write"))`. This indicates a bug in EventCore's multi-stream event writing pipeline where valid events are being filtered out before reaching the database.

### Batch Event Writes

**Test Configuration**:
- Operations: 20 batches of 100 events each (2,000 total events)
- Pattern: Direct event store writes
- Target: ‚â•20,000 events/sec

**Results** (Latest - 2025-07-01):
- **Throughput**: 0.00 events/sec ‚ùå (total failure)
- **Success Rate**: 0% (0/2,000 successful) ‚ùå
- **P95 Latency**: 0.00ms (no successful operations)
- **Total Duration**: 0.01 seconds

**Analysis**: ‚ùó **Same EventCore bug** affects batch writes - likely the same "No events to write" error occurring in the bulk writing pipeline.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

1. **Business Logic Validation (RESOLVED)**:
   - ‚úÖ **Single-stream commands**: Now 100% success rate
   - ‚úÖ **Account/stream initialization**: Fixed stream naming and setup
   - ‚úÖ **Validation rules**: Proper initial funds and inventory setup
   - ‚úÖ **Database schema**: All compatibility issues resolved

2. **Schema Compatibility (COMPLETED)**:
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: `event_version` vs `stream_position` mismatch
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Missing `correlation_id`/`causation_id` columns
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: `current_version` column naming
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: `correlation_id` type mismatch (UUID ‚Üí VARCHAR)

### Critical Outstanding Issues ‚ùå

1. **EventCore Multi-Stream Bug**:
   - **Symptom**: `EventStore(Internal("No events to write"))` error
   - **Scope**: Affects multi-stream commands and batch writes
   - **Root cause**: Events are created successfully but filtered out in writing pipeline
   - **Impact**: 100% failure rate for multi-stream operations
   - **Priority**: Critical - requires EventCore core library fix

2. **PostgreSQL Performance Gap**:
   - **Single-stream throughput**: 62-90 ops/sec vs 5,000-10,000 target (55-80x slower)
   - **Latency**: 14-20ms vs 10ms target
   - **Likely causes**: Database round-trips, transaction overhead, connection pooling settings

### Performance Characteristics (Successful Operations Only)

For single-stream operations (now 100% successful):

**Latency Profile**:
- **Single-stream**: Good latency (14-20ms P95, slightly above 10ms target)
- **Consistency**: Stable performance across multiple test runs
- **Range**: Min 6ms, Max 72ms with most operations completing within 15-20ms

**Throughput**: PostgreSQL-based operations are inherently slower than in-memory targets. The infrastructure is sound but optimized for correctness over raw speed.

## Recommendations

### Critical Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix EventCore Multi-Stream Bug** üî•:
   - **Action**: Debug and fix the "No events to write" error in EventCore library
   - **Location**: Event writing pipeline, likely in stream validation or batch preparation
   - **Impact**: Currently blocks 100% of multi-stream and batch operations
   - **Investigation needed**: Examine why valid events are filtered out before database write

2. **Validate Performance Targets**:
   - **Reassess targets**: Current targets (5,000-10,000 ops/sec) may be unrealistic for PostgreSQL-based systems
   - **Benchmarking**: Compare against similar event sourcing libraries with PostgreSQL backends
   - **Consider trade-offs**: EventCore prioritizes correctness and multi-stream atomicity over raw speed

### Performance Optimization (Medium Priority)

Once failure rates are resolved:

1. **Connection Pooling**: Optimize PostgreSQL connection settings
2. **Batch Processing**: Improve bulk event writing efficiency  
3. **Index Optimization**: Fine-tune indexes for test workloads
4. **Concurrency**: Increase parallelism in test execution

### Long-term Improvements (Lower Priority)

1. **Production Schema**: Implement partitioned schema for scale testing
2. **Realistic Data**: Use production-like data volumes and patterns
3. **Load Testing**: Extended duration tests under sustained load
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Add performance monitoring and alerting

## Test Framework Validation

‚úÖ **Successfully Completed**:
- Database schema alignment with code expectations
- Real PostgreSQL benchmark execution
- Comprehensive performance measurement and reporting
- Proper error handling and metrics collection
- Elimination of previous bugs (impossible success rates, overflow errors)

## Migration Issues Resolved

‚úÖ **Fixed Database Schema Issues**:
- Removed `CONCURRENTLY` from initial table creation migrations
- Fixed `NOW()` predicates that aren't immutable for index creation
- Aligned column names (`event_version` vs `stream_position`)
- Fixed type mismatches (`correlation_id` UUID vs VARCHAR)
- Added missing `current_version` column in `event_streams` table
- Successfully applied migrations 001-003 for core functionality

## Conclusion

**‚úÖ Major Progress Achieved**: The performance validation framework has successfully **resolved all business logic validation issues**. Single-stream commands now achieve 100% success rates, demonstrating that the EventCore infrastructure works correctly for basic operations.

**‚ùå Critical Issue Identified**: A significant bug in EventCore's multi-stream event writing pipeline prevents multi-stream commands and batch operations from functioning. This is a core library issue requiring immediate attention.

**üìä Performance Assessment**: For working operations (single-stream), EventCore achieves good latency (14-20ms P95) but throughput is 55-80x below targets. This gap may indicate that the original performance targets were overly optimistic for PostgreSQL-based systems.

## Status Summary

| Component | Status | Success Rate | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| **Business Logic** | ‚úÖ Fixed | 100% (single-stream) | All validation issues resolved |

| **Multi-Stream Ops** | ‚ùå Blocked | 0% | EventCore library bug |
| **Batch Writes** | ‚ùå Blocked | 0% | Same EventCore library bug |
| **Database Schema** | ‚úÖ Complete | 100% | All migrations working |

**Next Steps**: 
1. **Priority 1**: Fix EventCore multi-stream bug to enable comprehensive performance testing
2. **Priority 2**: Reassess performance targets based on realistic PostgreSQL capabilities
3. **Priority 3**: Optimize single-stream performance through connection pooling and indexing
