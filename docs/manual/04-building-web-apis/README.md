# Part 4: Building Web APIs

This part shows how to expose your EventCore application through HTTP APIs. We'll cover command handlers, query endpoints, authentication, and API design best practices.

## Chapters in This Part

1. **[Setting Up HTTP Endpoints](./01-setting-up-endpoints.md)** - Web framework integration
2. **[Command Handlers](./02-command-handlers.md)** - Exposing commands via HTTP
3. **[Query Endpoints](./03-query-endpoints.md)** - Building read APIs with projections
4. **[Authentication and Authorization](./04-authentication.md)** - Securing your API
5. **[API Versioning](./05-api-versioning.md)** - Evolving APIs without breaking clients

## What You'll Learn

- Integrate EventCore with popular Rust web frameworks
- Design RESTful and GraphQL APIs for event-sourced systems
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Build efficient query endpoints using projections
- Version your API as your system evolves

## Prerequisites

- Completed Part 3: Core Concepts
- Basic understanding of HTTP and REST APIs
- Familiarity with at least one Rust web framework helpful

## Framework Examples

This part includes examples for:

- **Axum** - Modern, ergonomic web framework
- **Actix Web** - High-performance actor-based framework
- **Rocket** - Type-safe, developer-friendly framework

## Time to Complete

- Reading: ~45 minutes
- With implementation: ~2 hours
