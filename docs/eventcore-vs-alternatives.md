## EventCore vs. EventStore

### EventStore Strengths
- **Mature ecosystem** with years of production use
- **Higher throughput** (~500+ ops/sec vs EventCore's ~90)
- **Rich tooling** including web UI, monitoring, clustering
- **Language agnostic** with clients for many languages
- **Proven scalability** in high-traffic applications

### EventCore Advantages
- **Multi-stream atomicity** - EventStore requires sagas for cross-stream operations
- **Type safety** - Compile-time guarantees vs runtime errors
- **Simpler operational model** - Just PostgreSQL vs EventStore cluster
- **No distributed transactions** - Atomic operations across multiple streams

### Code Comparison

**EventStore (multi-entity operation)**:
```csharp
// EventStore: Requires saga for atomicity
public class TransferSaga : Saga<TransferSagaData>
{
    // 1. Withdraw from source account
    Handle<WithdrawMoney>()
    {
        // Send command to account aggregate
        // Handle potential failure
    }
    
    // 2. Handle successful withdrawal
    Handle<MoneyWithdrawn>()
    {
        // Send deposit command
        // Handle potential failure
    }
    
    // 3. Handle failed deposit
    Handle<DepositFailed>()
    {
        // Send compensating withdrawal
        // Complex error handling
    }
}
```

**EventCore (multi-entity operation)**:
```rust
// EventCore: Single atomic command
#[async_trait]
impl Command for TransferMoney {
    fn read_streams(&self, input: &Self::Input) -> Vec<StreamId> {
        vec![input.from.stream_id(), input.to.stream_id()]
    }
    
    async fn handle(&self, streams: ReadStreams, ...) -> CommandResult<...> {
        // Atomic across both accounts - no saga needed
        Ok(vec![
            StreamWrite::new(&streams, input.from, MoneyWithdrawn { amount }),
            StreamWrite::new(&streams, input.to, MoneyDeposited { amount }),
        ])
    }
}
```

### When to Choose EventStore
- **High throughput requirements** (1000+ ops/sec)
- **Mature ecosystem** is critical
- **Multi-language team** needs consistent tooling
- **Existing EventStore expertise** in the team
- **Single-entity operations** are sufficient

### When to Choose EventCore
- **Cross-entity operations** are common
- **Type safety** is a priority
- **Operational simplicity** is valued
- **PostgreSQL expertise** exists in the team
- **Correctness over performance** trade-off is acceptable

## EventCore vs. Axon Framework

### Axon Framework Strengths
- **Enterprise features** like event scheduling, sagas, distributed command handling
- **Spring integration** for Java/Spring teams
- **Rich monitoring** and operational tools
- **Mature documentation** and community
- **High performance** with specialized event store

### EventCore Advantages
- **Multi-stream atomicity** without saga complexity
- **Type safety** with Rust's compile-time guarantees
- **Simpler mental model** - commands define their own boundaries
- **Less boilerplate** - no aggregate classes or complex configuration

### Architecture Comparison

**Axon Framework**:
```java
// Complex aggregate with rigid boundaries
@Aggregate
public class Account {
    @AggregateIdentifier
    private AccountId id;
    private Money balance;
    
    // Can only access this one account
    @CommandHandler
    public void handle(WithdrawMoney command) {
        // Cannot atomically access other accounts
        // Requires saga for transfers
    }
}

@Saga
public class TransferSaga {
    // Complex saga management
    // Distributed transaction handling
    // Compensation logic
}
```

**EventCore**:
```rust
// Simple command with flexible boundaries
struct TransferMoney {
    from: AccountId,
    to: AccountId,
    amount: Money,
}

impl Command for TransferMoney {
    // Define boundary dynamically per operation
    fn read_streams(&self, input: &Self::Input) -> Vec<StreamId> {
        vec![input.from.stream_id(), input.to.stream_id()]
    }
    
    // No saga needed - atomic operation
}
```

### When to Choose Axon
- **Java/Spring ecosystem** is required
- **Enterprise features** like scheduling are needed
- **Existing Axon expertise** in the team
- **High-throughput** requirements
- **Complex workflow management** beyond simple commands

### When to Choose EventCore
- **Rust ecosystem** is preferred
- **Multi-stream operations** without saga complexity
- **Type safety** is critical
- **Simpler operational model** is desired
- **PostgreSQL-based** infrastructure

## EventCore vs. Custom Event Sourcing

### Custom Implementation Strengths
- **Perfect fit** for specific requirements
- **Full control** over performance and features
- **No external dependencies** beyond database
- **Optimized** for exact use case

### EventCore Advantages
- **Battle-tested patterns** and implementations
- **Type safety** built-in with compile-time guarantees
- **Multi-stream support** without custom distributed transaction logic
- **Comprehensive testing** including property-based tests
- **Documentation and examples** for common patterns

### Development Effort Comparison

**Custom Implementation**:
```rust
// You need to build all of this:
struct EventStore {
    // Connection management
    // Serialization/deserialization
    // Optimistic concurrency control
    // Transaction management
    // Event ordering
    // Stream versioning
    // Error handling
    // Retry logic
    // Performance monitoring
    // Testing infrastructure
}

// Plus: Multi-stream atomicity
// Plus: Type-safe stream access
// Plus: Dynamic stream discovery
// Plus: Comprehensive test suite
```

**EventCore**:
```rust
// Focus on your business logic:
#[derive(Command)]
struct YourCommand {
    // Your domain logic here
}

// Everything else is handled by EventCore
```

### When to Build Custom
- **Unique requirements** not met by existing solutions
- **Extreme performance** needs with specific optimizations
- **Existing expertise** in event sourcing implementation
- **Full control** over every aspect is critical

### When to Choose EventCore
- **Standard event sourcing** patterns are sufficient
- **Multi-stream operations** are needed
- **Type safety** is important
- **Faster development** is prioritized
- **Proven reliability** is valued

## EventCore vs. Traditional Database

### Traditional Database Strengths
- **Familiar mental model** for most developers
- **Mature tooling** and ecosystem
- **High performance** for simple operations
- **Strong consistency** with ACID properties
- **Operational simplicity** with well-known patterns

### EventCore Advantages
- **Complete audit trail** with business context
- **Temporal queries** - see state at any point in time
- **Event-driven architectures** with natural integration
- **Immutable history** prevents data corruption
- **Complex business workflows** with atomic multi-entity operations

### Complexity Comparison

**Traditional Database**:
```sql
-- Simple operations are straightforward
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 'alice';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 'bob';
COMMIT;

-- But complex workflows require:
-- - Stored procedures for business logic
-- - Triggers for consistency
-- - Audit tables for history
-- - Complex error handling
-- - Transaction management
```

**EventCore**:
```rust
// Complex operations are as simple as basic ones
struct TransferMoney {
    from: AccountId,
    to: AccountId, 
    amount: Money,
}
// Business logic, audit trail, and consistency all handled
```

### Migration Path Comparison

| Migration Aspect | Traditional DB | EventCore |
|------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Gradual adoption** | ‚úÖ Easy | ‚úÖ By bounded context |
| **Data migration** | ‚úÖ Straightforward | üî∂ Requires event modeling |
| **Query complexity** | ‚úÖ Simple | üî∂ Requires projections |
| **Performance impact** | ‚úÖ Minimal | üî∂ Lower throughput |
| **Team training** | ‚úÖ Minimal | üî∂ Event sourcing concepts |

### When to Stick with Traditional DB
- **Simple CRUD operations** are sufficient
- **High performance** is critical (10,000+ ops/sec)
- **Team has no event sourcing experience**
- **Read-heavy workloads** with complex queries
- **Rapid prototyping** with changing requirements

### When to Choose EventCore
- **Complex business workflows** spanning multiple entities
- **Audit requirements** beyond simple logging
- **Event-driven integrations** with other systems
- **Temporal analysis** of business processes
- **Cross-entity consistency** without distributed transactions
