# EventCore Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the EventCore multi-stream event sourcing library using a strict type-driven development approach with test-driven implementation.

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **CI/CD First**: Set up continuous integration before any code
2. **Type-First**: Define all types that make illegal states unrepresentable
   - Use `nutype` validation ONLY at library input boundaries
   - Once parsed into domain types, validity is guaranteed by the type system
   - No runtime validation needed within the library - types ensure correctness
3. **Stub Functions**: Create all function signatures with `todo!()` bodies
4. **Property Tests First**: Write property-based tests to verify invariants
5. **Test-Driven Implementation**: Replace `todo!()` with implementations guided by tests
6. **Integration Last**: Add infrastructure only after core logic is complete

## Phase 1: CI/CD and Project Setup

## Success Criteria

Each phase is complete when:

1. All types compile with no `todo!()` remaining
2. All property tests pass
3. Unit test coverage > 95%
4. Integration tests verify the complete flow
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. Performance meets PRD requirements

## Notes on Type-Driven Development Process

For each component:

1. **Design types first** - Make illegal states unrepresentable
2. **Create stubs** - All functions return `todo!()`
3. **Write property tests** - Define invariants that must hold
4. **Write unit tests** - Test specific behaviors
5. **Implement** - Replace `todo!()` guided by failing tests
6. **Refactor** - Improve implementation while tests pass
7. **Document** - Add rustdoc with examples

This approach ensures we think through the design before coding and that all code is tested from the start.

## Development Process Rules

When working on this project, **ALWAYS** follow these rules:

1. **Review @PLANNING.md** to discover the next task to work on.
2. **IMMEDIATELY use the todo list tool** to create a todolist with the specific actions you will take to complete the task.
3. **ALWAYS include "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks" in your todolist** - This task should come BEFORE the commit task to ensure completed work is tracked.
4. **Insert a task to "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"** after each discrete action that involves a change to the code, tests, database schema, or infrastructure.
5. **The FINAL item in the todolist MUST always be** to "Push your changes to the remote repository, monitor CI workflow with gh cli, and if it passes, review @PLANNING.md to discover the next task and review our process rules."

### CRITICAL: Todo List Structure

Your todo list should ALWAYS follow this pattern:
1. Implementation tasks...
2. "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks"
3. "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"
4. "Push changes to remote repository, monitor CI workflow..."

### CI Monitoring Rules

After pushing changes:
1. **Use `gh` CLI to monitor the CI workflow** - Watch for the workflow to complete
2. **If the workflow fails** - Address the failures immediately before moving to the next task
3. **If the workflow passes** - Only then proceed to review @PLANNING.md for the next task

Example commands:
```bash
# List recent workflow runs
gh run list --limit 5

# Watch a specific workflow run
gh run watch

# View workflow run details if it fails
gh run view
```

### Commit Rules

**BEFORE MAKING ANY COMMIT**:
1. **Ensure @PLANNING.md is updated** - All completed tasks must be marked with [x]
2. **Include the updated PLANNING.md in the commit** - Use `git add PLANNING.md`

**NEVER** make a commit with the `--no-verify` flag. All pre-commit checks must be passing before proceeding. If pre-commit checks fail:
- Fix the issues identified (formatting, linting, tests)
- Run the checks again
- Only commit when all checks pass
