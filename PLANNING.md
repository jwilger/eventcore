# EventCore Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the EventCore multi-stream event sourcing library using a strict type-driven development approach with test-driven implementation.

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **CI/CD First**: Set up continuous integration before any code
2. **Type-First**: Define all types that make illegal states unrepresentable
   - Use `nutype` validation ONLY at library input boundaries
   - Once parsed into domain types, validity is guaranteed by the type system
   - No runtime validation needed within the library - types ensure correctness
3. **Stub Functions**: Create all function signatures with `todo!()` bodies
4. **Property Tests First**: Write property-based tests to verify invariants
5. **Test-Driven Implementation**: Replace `todo!()` with implementations guided by tests
6. **Integration Last**: Add infrastructure only after core logic is complete

## Phase 1-14: Core Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

All initial implementation phases have been completed successfully, including:
- CI/CD pipeline and project setup
- Core type system with validated domain types
- Command system with type-safe stream access
- Event store abstraction and adapters (PostgreSQL, in-memory)
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Property-based tests for system invariants
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Developer experience improvements (macros, error diagnostics)
- Complete examples (banking, e-commerce)
- Documentation and release preparation

## Phase 15: Post-Review Improvements

Based on the comprehensive expert review, the following improvements have been identified:

### 15.0 Type Safety Improvements (2025-07-02)

**Addresses critical race condition bug discovered during development**

- [x] **Fix Executor Race Condition with Type Safety**
  - [x] Identified race condition where executor re-read streams between command execution and event writing
  - [x] Designed typestate pattern API to make race condition impossible at compile time
  - [x] Implemented phantom types to track execution states (StreamsRead, StateReconstructed, CommandExecuted)
  - [x] Created ExecutionScope that captures StreamData once and flows it through all execution phases
  - [x] Updated executor to use type-safe API, eliminating possibility of race conditions
  - [x] Added compile-time tests documenting incorrect usage patterns that won't compile
  - **RESULT**: Race conditions between state reconstruction and event writing are now impossible by design

### 15.1 Simplify API Surface and Reduce Complexity

**Addresses feedback from Rich Hickey, Ward Cunningham, and Without Boats regarding complexity management**

- [x] **Consolidate Command Creation Approaches**
  - [x] Evaluate usage patterns of manual vs procedural macro vs declarative macro approaches
  - [x] Choose one primary approach and deprecate others for 1.0 release
  - [x] Update documentation to focus on the chosen approach
  - [x] Provide clear migration paths for existing code

- [x] **Enhanced Command Derive Macro** (NEW - 2025-07-03)
  - [x] Eliminate need for manual `type Input = Self;` declarations in simple commands
  - [x] Remove boilerplate `type StreamSet = CommandNameStreamSet;` specifications  
  - [x] Auto-generate `__derive_read_streams()` helper method from `#[stream]` fields
  - [x] Create comprehensive documentation and examples demonstrating 50% boilerplate reduction
  - [x] Maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing manual implementations
  - **RESULT**: Command implementation now focuses primarily on domain logic rather than boilerplate

- [x] **Command Trait Separation** (ENHANCED - 2025-07-03)
  - [x] Split Command trait into CommandStreams (infrastructure) and CommandLogic (domain)
  - [x] Update derive macro to generate complete CommandStreams implementation
  - [x] Implement blanket implementation: `impl<T: CommandStreams + CommandLogic> Command for T`
  - [x] Move ReadStreams, StreamWrite, and StreamResolver from command_old.rs to command.rs
  - [x] Export CommandStreams and CommandLogic from lib.rs for public use
  - [x] Create migration guide at docs/migration-guide-trait-separation.md
  - [x] Update enhanced-command-macro.md documentation with new pattern
  - [x] Update simplified_command_example.rs to demonstrate new pattern
  - **RESULT**: Clean separation of concerns - derive macro handles all infrastructure, users focus on domain logic

- [x] **Simplify Command API Further** (COMPLETED - 2025-07-03)
  - [x] Remove `Input` associated type from CommandStreams trait
  - [x] Update CommandLogic trait to remove input parameter from handle method
  - [x] Update derive macro to match new trait signatures  
  - [x] Update executor methods to only take command parameter
  - [x] Update all example commands to use new API
  - [x] Update tests to use new API (core library 503 tests passing - all tests updated)
  - [x] Update documentation and migration guide
  - **RATIONALE**: Commands should always be their own input - having separate input types adds unnecessary complexity
  - **RESULT**: Simplified API where commands contain all their data, eliminating redundancy

- [x] **Remove Over-Engineering**
  - [x] Evaluate and remove other premature optimizations identified in review
  - [x] Simplify configuration options where possible

- [x] **Magic Number Configuration**
  - [x] Replace hardcoded `MAX_ITERATIONS: usize = 10` with configurable parameter

  - [x] Benchmark performance improvements from removing async-trait overhead
  - [x] Update MSRV if necessary for native async traits
  - **Decision**: Migration not recommended due to trait object compatibility issues and minimal performance benefit. See ASYNC_TRAIT_MIGRATION.md for detailed analysis.

- [x] **Dependency Optimization**
  - [x] Add granular Tokio feature flags to reduce dependency weight
  - [x] Evaluate and remove unnecessary dependency features
  - [x] Update workspace Cargo.toml with minimal feature requirements

  - [x] Investigate type-level lists for stream access control (INFEASIBLE - Requires compile-time knowledge)
  - [x] **FINDING**: 100% of stream IDs are runtime data (account IDs, product IDs, etc.) making compile-time validation impossible
  - [x] **ALTERNATIVE**: Focus on runtime optimization opportunities identified in analysis
  - [x] **CLEANUP**: Remove flawed analysis documents and organize remaining docs in docs/ directory

## Development Process Rules

When working on this project, **ALWAYS** follow these rules:

1. **BROKEN CI BUILDS ARE HIGHEST PRIORITY** - If CI is failing, stop all other work and fix it immediately.
2. **Review @PLANNING.md** to discover the next task to work on.
3. **IMMEDIATELY use the todo list tool** to create a todolist with the specific actions you will take to complete the task.
4. **ALWAYS include "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks" in your todolist** - This task should come BEFORE the commit task to ensure completed work is tracked.
5. **Insert a task to "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"** after each discrete action that involves a change to the code, tests, database schema, or infrastructure.
6. **The FINAL item in the todolist MUST always be** to "Push your changes to the remote repository, monitor CI workflow with gh cli, and if it passes, review @PLANNING.md to discover the next task and review our process rules."

### CRITICAL: Todo List Structure

Your todo list should ALWAYS follow this pattern:
1. Implementation tasks...
2. "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks"
3. "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"
4. "Push changes to remote repository, monitor CI workflow..."

### CI Monitoring Rules

After pushing changes:
1. **Use `gh` CLI to monitor the CI workflow** - Watch for the workflow to complete
2. **If the workflow fails** - Address the failures immediately before moving to the next task
3. **If the workflow passes** - Only then proceed to review @PLANNING.md for the next task

### Commit Rules

**BEFORE MAKING ANY COMMIT**:
1. **Ensure @PLANNING.md is updated** - All completed tasks must be marked with [x]
2. **Include the updated PLANNING.md in the commit** - Use `git add PLANNING.md`

**COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT**:
- **NO PREFIXES** in subject line (no "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:", etc.)
- **Subject line**: Maximum 50 characters, imperative mood
- **Body lines**: Maximum 72 characters before hard-wrapping
- **Focus on WHY, not just what/how** - Explain the reasoning and motivation
- Example:
  ```
  Add subscription system with position tracking
  
  Expert review identified missing subscription capabilities as a major
  gap preventing production usage. Without real-time event processing,
  projections cannot stay current and users lose audit trail benefits.
  
  Implement comprehensive subscription system with automatic position
  tracking, checkpointing, and replay functionality. This enables
  real-time read models and eliminates polling-based workarounds.
  
  All integration tests pass with PostgreSQL backend.
  ```

**NEVER** make a commit with the `--no-verify` flag. All pre-commit checks must be passing before proceeding.

## Notification Sound

**IMPORTANT**: Claude should play a notification sound every time it finishes tasks and is waiting for user input. This helps the user know when Claude has completed its work.

To play a notification sound on NixOS with PipeWire:
```bash
python3 -c "
import wave, struct, math

# Create a simple beep WAV file
sample_rate = 44100
duration = 0.5
frequency = 440

with wave.open('/tmp/beep.wav', 'wb') as wav:
    wav.setnchannels(1)
    wav.setsampwidth(2)
    wav.setframerate(sample_rate)
    
    for i in range(int(sample_rate * duration)):
        value = int(32767.0 * math.sin(2.0 * math.pi * frequency * i / sample_rate))
        wav.writeframesraw(struct.pack('<h', value))
" && pw-play /tmp/beep.wav
```
