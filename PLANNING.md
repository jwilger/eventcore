# EventCore Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the EventCore multi-stream event sourcing library using a strict type-driven development approach with test-driven implementation.

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **CI/CD First**: Set up continuous integration before any code
2. **Type-First**: Define all types that make illegal states unrepresentable
   - Use `nutype` validation ONLY at library input boundaries
   - Once parsed into domain types, validity is guaranteed by the type system
   - No runtime validation needed within the library - types ensure correctness
3. **Stub Functions**: Create all function signatures with `todo!()` bodies
4. **Property Tests First**: Write property-based tests to verify invariants
5. **Test-Driven Implementation**: Replace `todo!()` with implementations guided by tests
6. **Integration Last**: Add infrastructure only after core logic is complete

## Core Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETED

All initial implementation phases (1-15) have been completed successfully, including:
- CI/CD pipeline and project setup
- Core type system with validated domain types
- Command system with type-safe stream access
- Event store abstraction and adapters (PostgreSQL, in-memory)
- Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- Property-based tests for system invariants
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Developer experience improvements (macros, error diagnostics)
- Complete examples (banking, e-commerce)
- Documentation and release preparation
- Expert review improvements and API simplification
- Production hardening and observability features

## Phase 16: Comprehensive Type System Analysis ✅ COMPLETED

  - [x] Analyzed test patterns to understand what runtime failures each test is designed to catch
  - [x] Created comprehensive test inventory with detailed categorization

- [x] **Type System Improvement Analysis** ✅ COMPLETED  
  - [x] Analyzed each category of tests for type system improvement opportunities
  - [x] Identified specific runtime failures that could be prevented at compile time
  - [x] Evaluated developer experience tradeoffs for each potential improvement

  - [x] **HIGH VALUE, LOW RISK**: Event ordering performance optimization
  - [x] **HIGH VALUE, LOW RISK**: Command execution performance optimization
  - [x] **MODERATE VALUE**: Business rule validation optimization

## Phase 17: Next Implementation Priority

### Phase 17.1: Performance and Reliability Improvements (High Value, Low Risk)

1. **Stream Access Validation Performance Optimization** ✅ **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: O(1) hash set lookup in `StreamWrite::new()` (line 319 in src/command.rs)
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Pre-computed hash sets in `ReadStreams` construction (line 281 in src/command.rs)
   - **ANALYSIS**: The optimization was already implemented! Current code uses:
     - `ReadStreams.stream_set: HashSet<StreamId>` for O(1) validation
     - `read_streams.stream_set.contains(&stream_id)` for fast lookup
     - Hash set pre-computation during `ReadStreams::new()` construction
   - **IMPACT**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - O(n) cost eliminated, using O(1) hash set lookup
   - **RISK**: ✅ **MINIMAL** - Implementation uses standard library HashSet

2. **Event Ordering Performance Optimization** ✅ **ALREADY OPTIMIZED**
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Database-level ordering with `ORDER BY event_id` in PostgreSQL
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: UUIDv7-based chronological ordering without validation overhead
   - ✅ **COMPLETED**: Efficient sorting algorithms (database B-tree indexes, Timsort for memory)
   - **ANALYSIS**: Current implementation is already optimal:
     - PostgreSQL: Uses B-tree indexes on event_id for O(log n) ordering
     - Memory: Timsort for unavoidable in-memory sorting operations
     - UUIDv7: Built-in timestamp ordering eliminates validation overhead
     - No O(n) scans in hot paths - all operations use optimal data structures
   - **IMPACT**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Optimal event ordering performance

   - **IMPACT**: ✅ **ACHIEVED** - Significant performance improvement for repeated business rule validation
   - **COMPLEXITY**: ✅ **MINIMAL** - Clean API with opt-in optimization, no breaking changes
   - **RISK**: ✅ **LOW** - Comprehensive testing ensures correctness, caching is transparent

### Phase 17.3: Research and Document (Future Work) ✅ **COMPLETED**

## Phase 18: Advanced Phantom Type Implementation

### Objective

Identify and implement opportunities to apply advanced phantom type patterns throughout the EventCore codebase to further enhance type safety and eliminate runtime checks.

### Background

Advanced phantom types can provide compile-time guarantees for:
- **State Machine Types**: Encode command execution phases (e.g., Reading → Processing → Writing)
- **Permission Types**: Compile-time access control (e.g., ReadOnly vs ReadWrite access)
- **Protocol Phases**: Type-safe command protocols and transitions
- **Resource Lifecycle**: Ensure resources are acquired, used, and released in correct order

### Tasks

1. **Codebase Analysis for Phantom Type Opportunities**
   - [x] Analyze command execution flow for state machine encoding opportunities
   - [x] Identify permission and access control patterns that could be type-encoded
   - [x] Find protocol/workflow patterns that could benefit from type-safe transitions
   - [x] Document resource lifecycle patterns that could use phantom types

2. **Implementation Priorities**
   - [ ] Create detailed implementation plan for each identified opportunity
   - [ ] Prioritize based on:
     - Runtime error prevention potential
     - Performance improvement (eliminating runtime checks)
     - Developer experience enhancement
     - Implementation complexity

3. **Prototype and Validate**
   - [ ] Implement proof-of-concept for highest priority patterns
   - [ ] Measure compile-time and runtime impact
   - [ ] Gather feedback on API ergonomics
   - [ ] Create migration guide for existing code

### Example Pattern

```rust
// Current approach (runtime validation)
struct Command {
    data: CommandData,
    state: CommandState, // Validated at runtime
}

// Advanced phantom type approach (compile-time validation)
struct Command<State> {
    data: CommandData,
    _phantom: PhantomData<State>,
}

// States as zero-sized types
struct Initialized;
struct Validated;
struct Executed;

// Type-safe transitions
impl Command<Initialized> {
    fn validate(self) -> Result<Command<Validated>, ValidationError> {
        // Validation logic
    }
}

impl Command<Validated> {
    fn execute(self) -> Result<Command<Executed>, ExecutionError> {
        // Can only execute validated commands
    }
}
```

## Expected Outcomes

**Performance Improvements:**
- Stream validation: O(n) → O(1) improvement for every stream write
- 15-20% reduction in validation overhead
- Better compiler optimization opportunities
- Additional runtime check elimination through phantom types

**Developer Experience:**
- 30-40% reduction in test failures due to type prevention  
- Clearer intent through types that document constraints
- Better IDE support with more accurate error detection
- Compile-time enforcement of correct API usage patterns

**Maintainability:**
- Self-documenting code with types encoding business rules
- Easier refactoring with compiler-guided changes
- Reduced testing burden for compile-time prevented errors
- State machines and protocols enforced by type system

## Phase 19: Dead Code Cleanup

### Objective

Identify and remove dead code, unused files, and obsolete modules to improve codebase maintainability.

### Tasks

1. **Dead Code Analysis**
   - [ ] Search for unused files (e.g., `command_old.rs`)
   - [ ] Identify unused imports and dependencies
   - [ ] Find commented-out code blocks that should be removed
   - [ ] Locate disabled tests and examples that are no longer relevant

2. **Cleanup Actions**
   - [ ] Remove identified dead code files
   - [ ] Clean up unused imports and dependencies
   - [ ] Remove or update outdated comments
   - [ ] Update Cargo.toml files to remove unused dependencies

3. **Validation**
   - [ ] Ensure all tests still pass after cleanup
   - [ ] Verify examples still compile and run
   - [ ] Check that no active code was accidentally removed

## Development Process Rules

When working on this project, **ALWAYS** follow these rules:

1. **BROKEN CI BUILDS ARE HIGHEST PRIORITY** - If CI is failing, stop all other work and fix it immediately.
2. **Review @PLANNING.md** to discover the next task to work on.
3. **IMMEDIATELY use the todo list tool** to create a todolist with the specific actions you will take to complete the task.
4. **ALWAYS include "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks" in your todolist** - This task should come BEFORE the commit task to ensure completed work is tracked.
5. **Insert a task to "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"** after each discrete action that involves a change to the code, tests, database schema, or infrastructure.
6. **The FINAL item in the todolist MUST always be** to "Push your changes to the remote repository, monitor CI workflow with gh cli, and if it passes, review @PLANNING.md to discover the next task and review our process rules."

### CRITICAL: Todo List Structure

Your todo list should ALWAYS follow this pattern:
1. Implementation tasks...
2. "Update @PLANNING.md to mark completed tasks"
3. "Run all tests and make a commit if they all pass"
4. "Push changes to remote repository, monitor CI workflow..."

### CI Monitoring Rules

After pushing changes:
1. **Use `gh` CLI to monitor the CI workflow** - Watch for the workflow to complete
2. **If the workflow fails** - Address the failures immediately before moving to the next task
3. **If the workflow passes** - Only then proceed to review @PLANNING.md for the next task

### Commit Rules

**BEFORE MAKING ANY COMMIT**:
1. **Ensure @PLANNING.md is updated** - All completed tasks must be marked with [x]
2. **Include the updated PLANNING.md in the commit** - Use `git add PLANNING.md`

**COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT**:
- **NO PREFIXES** in subject line (no "feat:", "fix:", "refactor:", etc.)
- **Subject line**: Maximum 50 characters, imperative mood
- **Body lines**: Maximum 72 characters before hard-wrapping
- **Focus on WHY, not just what/how** - Explain the reasoning and motivation
- Example:
  ```
  Add subscription system with position tracking
  
  Expert review identified missing subscription capabilities as a major
  gap preventing production usage. Without real-time event processing,
  projections cannot stay current and users lose audit trail benefits.
  
  Implement comprehensive subscription system with automatic position
  tracking, checkpointing, and replay functionality. This enables
  real-time read models and eliminates polling-based workarounds.
  
  All integration tests pass with PostgreSQL backend.
  ```

**NEVER** make a commit with the `--no-verify` flag. All pre-commit checks must be passing before proceeding.

## Notification Sound

**IMPORTANT**: Claude should play a notification sound every time it finishes tasks and is waiting for user input. This helps the user know when Claude has completed its work.

To play a notification sound on NixOS with PipeWire:
```bash
python3 -c "
import wave, struct, math

# Create a simple beep WAV file
sample_rate = 44100
duration = 0.5
frequency = 440

with wave.open('/tmp/beep.wav', 'wb') as wav:
    wav.setnchannels(1)
    wav.setsampwidth(2)
    wav.setframerate(sample_rate)
    
    for i in range(int(sample_rate * duration)):
        value = int(32767.0 * math.sin(2.0 * math.pi * frequency * i / sample_rate))
        wav.writeframesraw(struct.pack('<h', value))
" && pw-play /tmp/beep.wav
```
