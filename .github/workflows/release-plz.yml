name: Release-plz

# This workflow creates release PRs when changes are pushed to main.
# It uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN to ensure
# that CI workflows are triggered on the created PR.
#
# Setup:
# Uses the existing PR_DRAFT_PAT secret which has the necessary permissions
#
# The workflow will:
# 1. Create a release PR with version bumps and changelog
# 2. Trigger CI checks on the PR (due to PAT usage)
#
# Publishing happens automatically when you merge the release PR.
# Release-plz handles the dependency order automatically.
