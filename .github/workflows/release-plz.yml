name: Release-plz

# This workflow handles both creating release PRs and publishing to crates.io.
# It uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN to ensure
# that CI workflows are triggered on the created PR.
#
# Setup:
# - PR_DRAFT_PAT: GitHub PAT with repo permissions for creating PRs
# - CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: crates.io token for publishing
#
# The workflow automatically:
# 1. Creates a release PR when changes are pushed to main
# 2. Publishes to crates.io when the release PR is merged
#
# Release-plz is smart enough to:
# - Only create/update PRs when there are unreleased changes
# - Only publish when its own release PR is merged
# - Handle the dependency order automatically

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: write
  id-token: write  # For publishing to crates.io
