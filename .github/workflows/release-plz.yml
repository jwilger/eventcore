# This workflow handles both creating release PRs and publishing to crates.io.
# It uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of GITHUB_TOKEN to ensure
# that CI workflows are triggered on the created PR.
#
# Setup:
# - PR_DRAFT_PAT: GitHub PAT with repo permissions for creating PRs
# - CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN: crates.io token for publishing
#
# The workflow has two different behaviors:
# 1. On regular push to main: Creates/updates a release PR (release-pr command)
# 2. When a release PR is merged: Publishes packages to crates.io (release command)
#
# This separation ensures that manual version bumps don't trigger immediate
# publishing, and that packages are published in the correct dependency order.

  pull-requests: write
