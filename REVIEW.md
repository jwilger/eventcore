# EventCore Architecture Review

_An imagined discussion between Edwin Brady, Philip Wadler, Conor McBride, Simon Peyton Jones, Bartosz Milewski, Ward Cunningham, and Kent Beck reviewing the EventCore codebase._

## Opening Discussion

**Kent Beck**: Let's start with what strikes me first - this is a beautiful example of test-driven development taken to its logical conclusion. The property-based tests in particular show a deep understanding of invariants.

**Philip Wadler**: Indeed, and the type-driven approach is exemplary. The use of phantom types in `StreamWrite<StreamSet, Event>` to ensure compile-time stream access control is precisely the kind of type-level programming we advocate for.

**Edwin Brady**: I'm particularly impressed by the "parse, don't validate" philosophy throughout. The `nutype` usage for smart constructors ensures that once you have a `StreamId` or `EventId`, it's guaranteed to be valid. This is exactly what we mean by making illegal states unrepresentable.

**Conor McBride**: The type-level machinery here is subtle but effective. The way commands carry their `StreamSet` type parameter through to enforce which streams they can write to - that's a lovely example of using the type system as a proof assistant.

## Core Architecture Discussion

### The Multi-Stream Event Sourcing Pattern

**Bartosz Milewski**: This multi-stream event sourcing pattern is fascinating from a category theory perspective. Each command essentially defines its own consistency boundary - it's like having a different category for each operation where the objects are the streams and the morphisms are the state transitions.

**Ward Cunningham**: What I find elegant is how this eliminates the artificial boundaries we often impose with traditional aggregates. The system adapts to the actual consistency requirements of each operation rather than forcing operations into predefined boxes.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: From a Haskell perspective, the `Command` trait is essentially a type class that captures both the computational pattern and the consistency requirements. The associated types create a nice family of related types that must satisfy certain properties.

### Type System Usage

**Edwin Brady**: The type-driven development here is superb. Look at how they've encoded business rules into types:

```rust
#[nutype(
    validate(predicate = |id: &uuid::Uuid| id.get_version() == Some(uuid::Version::SortRand)),
    derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord, AsRef, Deref, Serialize, Deserialize)
)]
pub struct EventId(uuid::Uuid);
```

This ensures at the type level that only UUIDv7 can be used for event IDs, giving you chronological ordering for free.

**Philip Wadler**: The correspondence between the type system and the domain model is remarkably clean. Each domain concept has its own type, eliminating primitive obsession entirely.

### Stream Access Control

**Conor McBride**: The `ReadStreams<StreamSet>` and `StreamWrite<StreamSet, Event>` design is particularly clever. It's reminiscent of indexed monads where the index tracks which resources you have access to.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: Yes, and the way `StreamWrite::new()` returns a `Result` based on whether the stream was declared - that's runtime checking, but only at the boundary. Once you have a `StreamWrite`, you know it's valid.

## Module-by-Module Review

### Core Types Module (`types.rs`)

**Philip Wadler**: The types module is a masterclass in domain modeling. Every type tells a story about what's valid in the system.

**Edwin Brady**: I particularly appreciate that they're not over-engineering. The validation rules are exactly what's needed for correctness, no more, no less.

### Command Module (`command.rs`)

**Kent Beck**: The command pattern implementation is clean and testable. Each command is self-contained with its own state type, making it easy to reason about and test in isolation.

**Bartosz Milewski**: From a theoretical standpoint, commands are endofunctors in the category of event streams. The `handle` method is the natural transformation.

### Event Store Module (`event_store.rs`)

**Ward Cunningham**: The adapter pattern here is textbook - the core library has no knowledge of persistence details. This is the kind of architectural boundary that makes systems evolvable.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: The generic nature of `EventStore<Event = E>` is nice - it allows type-safe usage while keeping the abstraction general.

### Executor Module (`executor.rs`)

**Kent Beck**: The executor's retry logic and flexible stream discovery show mature thinking about distributed systems realities.

**Conor McBride**: The loop-based execution with `StreamResolver` is elegant. It's essentially a fixed-point computation where the command keeps requesting streams until it has everything it needs.

### Projection System (`projection.rs`, `projection_manager.rs`, `projection_runner.rs`)

**Bartosz Milewski**: Projections are essentially folds over event streams - pure functional programming at its finest.

**Ward Cunningham**: The checkpoint management and status tracking show good operational thinking. This isn't just academically correct; it's production-ready.

## Design Patterns Analysis

### Type-Driven Development

**Edwin Brady**: This codebase is a perfect example of type-driven development done right:

1. Types are designed first to model the domain
2. Invalid states are impossible to construct
3. Functions are total - they handle all cases
4. Errors are values, not exceptions

**Philip Wadler**: The "theorems for free" principle applies throughout. Just from the types, you can deduce much about what functions do.

### Functional Core, Imperative Shell

**Simon Peyton Jones**: The separation between pure command logic and effectful execution is clean. Commands are pure state machines; the executor handles all the messy reality.

**Kent Beck**: This separation also makes testing much easier. You can test command logic without any infrastructure.

### Error Handling

**Conor McBride**: The error types are well-designed algebraic data types. Each variant carries exactly the information needed to understand what went wrong.

**Bartosz Milewski**: Error handling follows the "parse, don't validate" philosophy - errors are discovered at boundaries and then propagated as values.

## PostgreSQL Adapter Review

**Ward Cunningham**: The PostgreSQL adapter is a good example of keeping complexity where it belongs. The core library stays pure while the adapter handles all the database specifics.

**Kent Beck**: The schema initialization with advisory locks shows attention to real-world deployment scenarios. This kind of defensive programming prevents subtle production issues.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: Making the adapter generic over event type `E` rather than using a fixed JSON type is smart. It maintains type safety while allowing flexibility.

## Testing Strategy

**Kent Beck**: The testing pyramid is well-balanced:

- Property tests for invariants
- Unit tests for specific behaviors
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Benchmarks for performance

**Philip Wadler**: The property tests are particularly well-crafted. They test deep properties like "commands are idempotent" and "concurrent commands maintain consistency."

**Edwin Brady**: The test utilities module provides a nice DSL for building test data. This makes tests readable and maintainable.

## Areas for Enhancement

### Collective Observations

**Conor McBride**: The version cache in PostgreSQL adapter is initialized but never used. This seems like low-hanging fruit for performance improvement.

**Bartosz Milewski**: Event upcasting could be more sophisticated. As schemas evolve, you'll want ways to transform old events to new formats.

**Ward Cunningham**: Snapshot support would be valuable for long-lived streams. The architecture already supports it; it just needs implementation.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: The subscription system could benefit from more type-level guarantees about ordering and delivery semantics.

**Kent Beck**: Migration tooling is minimal. As this moves to production, you'll want more sophisticated schema evolution support.

**Philip Wadler**: Consider adding session types or linear types (when Rust supports them) to ensure streams are used correctly in concurrent contexts.

**Edwin Brady**: The examples could demonstrate more advanced patterns like process managers or complex sagas.

## Final Recommendations

### Overall System

**Ward Cunningham**: This is one of the cleanest event sourcing implementations I've seen. The multi-stream approach with dynamic consistency boundaries effectively addresses real problems with traditional aggregate designs.

**Kent Beck**: The test-driven approach is exemplary. Every component is thoroughly tested with appropriate testing strategies.

**Philip Wadler**: The type system usage is sophisticated without being clever for its own sake. Types serve the domain, not the other way around.

**Edwin Brady**: The type-driven development philosophy is consistently applied throughout. This codebase could serve as a teaching example.

**Bartosz Milewski**: From a theoretical perspective, the mathematical foundations are sound. The category theory is implicit but correct.

**Simon Peyton Jones**: The functional programming principles are well-applied. Pure cores with effectful shells, proper error handling, and good use of abstractions.

**Conor McBride**: The dependent-type-inspired patterns (phantom types, type-level stream sets) show forward-thinking design that will age well.

### Specific Module Recommendations

#### Core Library

- Consider adding effect tracking (when Rust supports it) to make side effects more explicit
- The type-level stream access control could be extended with more granular permissions
- Add support for event metadata schemas as types

#### PostgreSQL Adapter

- Implement the version cache for performance
- Consider connection pooling strategies for high-load scenarios
- Add support for partitioning strategies for large event stores

#### Testing Infrastructure

- Add chaos testing for distributed scenarios
- Consider property-based testing for the projection system
- Add performance regression testing to CI

#### Examples

- Add more complex domain examples (process managers, sagas)
- Show error recovery patterns
- Demonstrate event versioning strategies

## Conclusion

**Collective Agreement**: EventCore represents a solid implementation of multi-stream event sourcing concepts. The dynamic consistency boundaries, combined with type-safe stream access and a clean architectural separation, creates a system that is both theoretically sound and practically useful. The type-driven development approach ensures correctness while maintaining usability. This is the kind of system we'd be proud to recommend for production use, with the minor enhancements noted above to make it even more robust.

The codebase demonstrates that advanced type system features can be used to solve real problems without sacrificing readability or maintainability. It's a credit to the Rust ecosystem and to the thoughtful design that went into this library.
