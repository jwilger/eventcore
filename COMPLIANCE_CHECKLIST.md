## Using This Checklist

1. **Initial Assessment**: Review all items, marking those already addressed by EventCore
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify items requiring implementation in your application
3. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-risk items and regulatory requirements
4. **Implementation**: Use EventCore's patterns and guides to address gaps
5. **Validation**: Test security controls and document compliance
6. **Maintenance**: Regular reviews to ensure continued compliance

Remember: EventCore provides the foundation, but compliance requires proper implementation at the application level.
