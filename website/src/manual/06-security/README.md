# Security

This section covers security best practices for building secure applications with EventCore.

## Topics

- [Overview](./01-overview.md) - Security responsibilities and architecture
- [Authentication & Authorization](./02-authentication.md) - Implementing access control
- [Data Encryption](./03-encryption.md) - Protecting sensitive data
- [Input Validation](./04-validation.md) - Preventing injection attacks
- [Compliance](./05-compliance.md) - Meeting regulatory requirements

## Key Principles

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of security
2. **Least Privilege** - Grant minimal necessary access
3. **Fail Secure** - Default to denying access
4. **Audit Everything** - Log security events
5. **Encrypt Sensitive Data** - Protect data at rest and in transit
